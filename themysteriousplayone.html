        <p>Isaiah let out a puff of smoke. The gray swirls opaqued over the blue glow of his iPhone. He could only use his left hand to type, since his right hand held the cigarette.</p>

        <p>“It’s a Black Devil,” Meow Meow had said as she handed him one earlier that night. The matte black cigarette didn’t fit in with her delicate, innocent hands. Her nails had been girlishly painted purple and pink, too. But the fluid motion in which she lit her cigarette, and how she inhaled the smoke as if it were water made her seem fifty, not eighteen. Maybe she has 9 lives, thought Isaiah as Meow walked away.</p>

        <p>Isaiah took one last sip of the Black Devil and stomped it out. One-handed typing was too slow; he needed both hands.</p>

        <img class="value-img" src="images/themysteriousplay-text-01.jpg">

        <p>Isaiah could hear the EDM several minutes before he pulled up to the Zeta Theta Theta house. He looked out the window and saw some of the ZOO brothers—they looked identical, with their boat shoes, colored shorts, and shades perched on their heads… And they said Asians looked alike. Occasional, high-pitched screams from sorority girls could be heard from inside the house, and Isaiah toyed with the idea that they had developed a primitive form of echolocation. He was on his phone when the car door clicked open and Jess clambered in the front seat. She was dressed in a faux-aged, hipster look like always—the type of outfit you could buy for $2 at Goodwill, or for $200 at a designer brand (Jess preferred the latter).</p>

        <p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: BCD? <br> Jess, exhaling: BCD. <br> The wild screeches of the jungle faded as Isaiah drove away.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Jess</strong>: So aren’t you going to ask about Jac? <br>
          Isaiah kept his eyes on the road: What’s there to ask? <br>
          <strong>Jess</strong>: Like, how he fucking came back from the dead? <br>
          Isaiah could feel Jess’s glare on him. He didn’t reply. What was he supposed to say to that? <br>
          Jess, exasperated: Ugh. Pass me the AUX cord. <br>
          <strong>Isaiah</strong>: Fuck no, we are not playing your obscure hipster shit. <br>
          He plugged the cord into his phone. <br>
          <strong>Isaiah</strong>: I’m already compromising by taking you to BCD, you vegan fuck.
        </p> 

        <p>
          ♫ Fuck that nigga that you love so bad ♫ <br>
          ♫ I know you still think about the times we had ♫ <br>
          ♫ I say fuck that nigga that you think you found ♫ <br>
          ♫ And since you picked up, I know he’s not around ♫ <br>
        </p>

        <p>They continued driving for a while. The store signs they passed went from English, to Spanish, and finally, to Korean.</p>

        <p>Jess’s phone vibrated in her purse. Isaiah heard her sharp gasp.</p>

        <p>
          [texting] <br>
          (Jac) <br>
          You told me not to worry about Mike <br>
          I saw you all over him... <br>
          It’s barely been one month you bitch <br>
          Where are you? <br>
          [/texting] <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Jess</strong>: This is fucked up… this is really fucked up. <br>
          <strong>Isaiah</strong>: Look, it’s probably one of the Zetas playing a prank. Relax. <br>
          Jess looked increasingly less relaxed. <br>
          <strong>Isaiah</strong>: Goddamn it… We’ll go to Jac’s suite and check it out, alright? <br>
          Jess nodded while biting her lip and holding back tears. <br>
        </p>  

        <p>Isaiah had been here many times before, back when Jac was still alive. East Tower was the most social of the residential halls. Everyone’s suite door was open, except for room 809. Jac’s room.
        Isaiah knocked. No answer. He twisted the knob and ventured inside.</p> 

        <p>Upon entering, they were greeted by a large pile of sneakers and Jordans, carelessly kicked off their owner’s feet. Hoodies and Obey snapbacks were strewn across the couch, directly across a flimsy table that seemed to bend with the weight of the bongs and vapes on top of it. There was a solitary, clear spot on the table where Jac would rest his feet during Call of Duty sessions.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Isaiah</strong>: Hello? <br>
          No answer. Roommates weren’t home. <br>
          <strong>Jess</strong>: Jac? <br>
          Isaiah rolled his eyes. <br>
        </p>

        <p>Then the two of them opened the door to Jac’s porch and leaned on the railing, staring out into the starless, night sky. They leaned because there were three chairs to sit in and only two people. And although they were silent, they both secretly hoped Jac would show up. So they kept waiting with their cigarettes in hand, and made clouds… the only type of clouds that can be seen at night.</p>
